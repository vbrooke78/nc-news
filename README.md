# FRONT END PROJECT - NC NEWS

This app is a news article site build using React. This was created during a week long sprint as part of a @Northcoders coding bootcamp.

The app uses a RESTful API which I created for my backend project using PostgreSQL for my database.

The app has been styled with CSS using a mobile-first approach.
